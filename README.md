Car Price Prediction

In this project I use different machine learning models and also build a deep learning model to predict the price of a used car based on different numerical and categorical 
features of each car. 
The results demonstrate the usefulness of different machine algorithms for this dataset. 
To create the scaled and split data, run the proj3_data_preprocess.ipynb notebook.
To demonstrate the modeling of different machine learning methods on this data run the proj3_machine_learning.ipynb notebook.
